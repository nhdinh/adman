# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** Any admin on the team can perform common AD/local-user & computer tasks correctly and safely — every destructive action is previewed (`-WhatIf`), confirmed, scoped to a managed OU, blocked from protected accounts, and written to an audit log.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Foundation & Safety Harness (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Foundation & Safety Harness)
Plan: 0 of ~5 in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-10 — Roadmap created (6 phases, blast-radius-ordered; 58/58 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Adopted research SUMMARY.md 6-phase blast-radius-ordered skeleton (0 Foundation/Safety → 1 Read-only reporting → 2 Single-object writes → 3 Remoting → 4 Bulk/workflows → 5 Hardening) as-is; it maps all 58 requirements.
- Roadmap: Governing principle locked — the safety spine (Phase 0) must exist and be proven (incl. a Pester test that no exported function calls AD write cmdlets directly) before any real write can merge.
- Roadmap: Config/credential split (Decided in PROJECT.md) — portable plain-JSON non-secret config + separate opt-in DPAPI-encrypted credential file, both in gitignored `.store/`; pass-through by default; no built-in RID baseline (protection via recursive admin-group membership + custom deny-list only).
- Roadmap: TUI is the product — `**UI hint**: no` for all phases (no browser frontend; `/gsd-ui-phase` not applicable).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0 research flag (HIGH): verify exact PSFramework 1.14.457 config/logging cmdlet signatures; DPAPI/`Export-Clixml` behavior across 5.1 vs 7.6; precise well-known-SID set for this environment's protected groups; RSAT server feature name vs target SKUs. Run `/gsd-plan-phase 0 --research-phase 0` if deeper research is needed.
- Phase 3 research flag (MEDIUM): confirm environment firewall reality for DCOM (135 + RPC dynamic) vs WinRM (5985/5986) before defaulting the ladder order.
- Phase 4 research flag (MEDIUM): confirm exact protected-group set, break-glass override policy, managed-OU roots, default max-count cap, and which offboarding cleanup items are checklist-only vs automated.
